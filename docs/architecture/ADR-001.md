# 1. Use Jison as a parser generator

Date: 2018-02-27

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a parser to be able to validate syntactically and semantically a QASM file. And a previous one with its grammar is already available from QX.

## Decision

We will use Jison and the original QASM grammar from the QX project.

##Â Consequences

It is not the most advanced parser generator, but it will allow us to create the first version of QStudio in a few days.
